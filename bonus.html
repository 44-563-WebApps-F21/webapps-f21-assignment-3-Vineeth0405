        the black N'Garai
    </H3>
    <p>
        The N'Garai are a group of demons created by the Elder God Chthon, after the 
        Demogorge's attack on the degenerated gods. They lived on Earth millions of years 
        ago, having enslaved humanity, but eventually left to live in another dimensional 
        plane after being banished by some force.
