 <h1> NEW NEWORK</h1>
     <P>New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and
        in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more 
        images to the collective consciousness of Americans: <b>Wall Street</b> means finance, Broadway is synonymous with 
        theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping,Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, 
        Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles,Seventh Avenue signifies fashion,Tammany Hall defines machine
        politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations,and slums.The word tenement 
        brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses.New York
        has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin,more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than
        San Juan.bol is the <b>Statue of Liberty</b>, but the metropolis is itself an icon,the arena in which Emma Lazarus’s 
        “tempest-tost” people of every nation are transformed into Americans—and if they remain in the city,they become New Yorkers</P>

     <h1>Finding a negative cycle in the graph</h1> 
     <blockquote>
        The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a 
        single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.[1] It 
        is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, 
        as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are 
        negative numbers. The algorithm was first proposed by Alfonso Shimbel (1955), 
        but is instead named after Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr., who published 
        it in 1958 and 1956, respectively.[2] Edward F. Moore also published a variation 
        of the algorithm in 1959, and for this reason it is also sometimes called the 
        Bellman–Ford–Moore algorithm.
