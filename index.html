 <h1> NEW NEWORK</h1>
     <P>New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and
        in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more 
        images to the collective consciousness of Americans: <b>Wall Street</b> means finance, Broadway is synonymous with 
        theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping,Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, 
        Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles,Seventh Avenue signifies fashion,Tammany Hall defines machine
        politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations,and slums.The word tenement 
        brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses.New York
        has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin,more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than
        San Juan.bol is the <b>Statue of Liberty</b>, but the metropolis is itself an icon,the arena in which Emma Lazarus’s 
        “tempest-tost” people of every nation are transformed into Americans—and if they remain in the city,they become New Yorkers</P>
